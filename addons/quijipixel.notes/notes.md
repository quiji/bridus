Unity and variety:
Using repetition of shapes and differente of tone, position and scale we can improve the composition.
Introducing a contrasting shape (using the same principles) we can make a more interesting composition.

Notes on resolution:
Resolution script works with Mode: 2d and Stretch:Ignore but it's not pixel perfect (rotating sprites will look wrong according to pixel art standards)


GAMME STUUUF:

Elles Animals:
Birds give neeews!
Egales reveal map areas!!
Bears are inn keepers!!!
Whales are transportation!!!

Tutorial,
A bird goes to Elles place and wakes her up saying that she is needed in town.
The cat is sleeping downstairs.
once outside, a biig tree that just falled blocks the way, a bird hints that a cat could climb the tree and drop
a rope for Elle to climb (teaching the team switch mechanics, the cat wall jump mechanic and ella's animal talk abilities)
