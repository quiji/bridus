Bridus:
What is bridus??

Hibrid ideas so far:
Music: Hibrid 8 bit and "high res" (Usage of Hibrid chords)
SFx: Generated 8bit sfx with high res sounds make for hibrid stuff??
Hibrid controller? NO

Music separated by 3 channels: Rhythm, Music, and "Voice", "mute" or change them accordingly to evoke
different things! :D

Birds!
Birds == Flocks health
Birds life == energy
Following Bird == Recovers energy
V formation == Speed and less energy loss, no accuracy
Line formation == Slow and lots of energy loss, great accuracy

Leader Bird == looses energy
Leader Bird == Transfers abilities to all birds, even if they don't have them

Hibridages:
  Firefly == light source (indarkness)
  Turtle == Armor (will bounce off walls)
  Rabbit == Dash
  Plant == Fotosintesis -> Recover energy from the sun
  
Combos:
  Turtle + Rabbit == Dash that breaks walls, and stomps enemies
  Plant + Firefly == Double light thanks to sun
  
  

RES: 320 x 160!
